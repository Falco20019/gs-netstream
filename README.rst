NetStream
=============


Netstream is basically a network protocol aiming at opening the `GraphStream`_ project access to other tools/projects/programs especially those written in other languages than Java. The interface is managed through a network interface (client/server approach) 

The aim of this gs-netstream project is to propose a repository of implementations of the protocol, written in various languages.  

.. _GraphStream: http://graphstream-project.org/

Implementations of the NetStrem protocol can be from the sender (client) side so as from the receiver (server) side.  

For now here are the implementations that are proposed:

- a python sender
- a C++ sender


If you need to implement a sender or a receiver in another language,
check the `manual`_ for a full description of the protocol
